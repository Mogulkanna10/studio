# **App Name**: RailWatch ITMS Dashboard

## Core Features:

- Real-Time Data Visualization: Display live data from LiDAR, Camera, IMU, Axle Encoder, and Ultrasonic sensors, with synchronized playback and chainage mapping. Use a tool to automatically identify correlations between disparate sensor data.
- Anomaly Detection & Alerting: Implement a real-time anomaly detection system that identifies deviations from baseline track conditions and triggers alerts on the dashboard.
- Interactive Data Analytics: Provide interactive charts and graphs for detailed analysis of sensor data, including FFT analysis, with customizable filters for time range, track section, and sensor type.
- Automated Report Generation: Generate PDF/CSV reports with auto-summarized insights using an AI model. Engineers can define a reporting schedule or create an on-demand report.
- Role-Based Access Control: Implement role-based authentication with specific access levels for administrators, inspectors, and viewers.
- Sensor and User Management: Enable administrators to manage sensor configurations, user roles, and system thresholds via a settings panel.
- Video Overlay Tool: Allow operators to highlight portions of video captured by cameras in the ITMS to bring anomalies or track defects to the attention of maintenance personnel.
